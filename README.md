# Rustic SQL

https://taller-1-fiuba-rust.github.io/proyecto/24C2/ejercicio_individual.html

## Project Overview

This project implements a rustic version of SQL using Rust, where tables are represented as CSV files (Comma Separated Values). The first row of each CSV file will define the column names, while subsequent rows will represent data records.

### Supported Operations

The program handles the following SQL commands:
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- SELECT

For SELECT queries, this project supports:

- WHERE clause (with restrictions)
- Comparison Operators (no support for LENGTH)
- Boolean Logic (without abbreviations)
- ORDER BY clause (sorting results)
